### Sample information ###
# The top level name should be the desired section name for the knitted document.
# The file prefixes should then be grouped based on subsampling group, with
# the names corresponding to the subsampling group name.
# Each file prefix should be given a name that will be shown on the plot. The
# name should include the replicate label at the end separated by an
# underscore.
#
# section_name:
#   group-name-1:                           # the group name should match the subsampling group name
#     sample-1_r1: sample_1_file_prefix_r1  # the root sample names should be the same between subsampling groups
#     sample-2_r1: sample_2_file_prefix_r1  # the replicate (_r#) should be included at the end of each sample name
# 
#   group-name-2:
#     sample-1_r2: sample_1_file_prefix_r2
#     sample-2_r2: sample_2_file_prefix_r2
