#===== Config file for filtering and aligning mNET-seq reads ===================

# Directories containing fastq files, this can be a relative path.
# Multiple directories can be provided. The sample names must correspond
# to the begining of the fastq name.

## Additional parameters for various processing steps
# Cutadapt
# --pair-filter=first - read filtering decisions are made based solely on R1
# --dicard-untrimmed  - remove reads that do not contain an adapter
# --minimum-length    - remove reads that are shorter than given value
# -O                  - minimum overlap to trim adapter
# -a                  - adapter sequence for R1
# -A                  - adapter sequence for R2
#
# umi tools
# --method unique     - only remove read if the UMI sequence is an exact match
# --read-length       - use read length when removing duplicates
#
# featureCounts
# -s 0                - strandedness for read assignment; 0, unstranded
# -t gene             - feature type for counting
# -O                  - count if aligned to multiple features
