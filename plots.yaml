### Sample information ###
# The top level name should be the desired section name for the knitted document.
# The file prefixes should then be grouped based on subsampling group, with
# the names corresponding to the subsampling group name.
# Each file prefix should be given a name that will be shown on the plot. The
# name should include the replicate label at the end separated by an
# underscore.
