#===== Sample config file ============================================


# Project name to use for naming summary files
PROJ:
    "MY-PROJECT"


# Docker container to use for pipeline
CONTAINER:
    "docker://rmsheridan/find-pauses:v3"


# Directories containing FASTQ files, this can be a relative path.
# * Multiple directories can be provided
# * The sample names must correspond to the begining of the fastq name
RAW_DATA:
    - "/beevol/home/erickson/fastqs/220218_A00405_0531_BH352HDRX2"


# Directory to store results
RESULTS:
    "results"


# Specify base URL and destination to transfer bigwigs
URL:
    "http://amc-sandbox.ucdenver.edu/User25/MY-PROJECT"

SSH:
    "sheridanr@amc-sandbox:~/public_html/MY-PROJECT"


# Base memory to request for each rule
# * The acutal amount requested will be higher for rules that generally
#   require more memory
# * A value of 8 will result in rules requesting between 8Gb - 32Gb of
#   memory
MEMORY:
    16


# Sample groups for subsampling, use the following format:
# * The top level name will be the section name for the knitted document.
# * Samples included in each sampling group will be subsampled to the same read
#   depth, so for each group select samples you want to directly compare.
# * The sample must match the beginning of a fastq file in one of the
#   RAW_DATA directories.
# * All samples listed for a section will be plotted together.
# * Each sample can be given a name to use when creating plots, if this
#   is excluded, names will be auto-generated.
# * Sampling groups can be included in multiple sections. This allows the samples
#   to be plotted in different combinations.
