# This gets appended to the mNET-seq and pausing configs


# Project name to use for naming summary files
PROJ:
    "Xrn2"


# Directories containing FASTQ files, this can be a relative path.
# Multiple directories can be provided. The sample names must correspond
# to the begining of the fastq name.

# FASTQ file suffix, can be either '.fastq.gz' or '.fq.gz'
# this is used to pull fastq files

# Base memory to request for each rule
# The acutal amount requested will be higher for rules that generally
# require more memory
# A value of 8 will result in rules requesting between 8Gb - 32Gb of
# memory

# Sample groups to use for subsampling, use the following format. The
# samples included in each group will be subsampled to the same read
# depth, so for each group select samples you want to directly compare.
# The sample names must match the beginning of a fastq file in one of the
# directories listed under RAW_DATA in NETseq.yaml. If the sample name
# matches multiple fastqs, an error will be thrown.
