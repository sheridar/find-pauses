# ===== Sample config file ============================================


# Project name to use for naming summary files
PROJ:
    "MY-PROJECT"


# Directory to save results
RESULTS:
    "results"


# Directories containing FASTQ files
# * Multiple directories can be provided
# * The sample names must correspond to the begining of the fastq name
RAW_DATA:
    - "/beevol/home/erickson/fastqs/220218_A00405_0531_BH352HDRX2"


# Genome to use for analysis
# the specified genome must have a config file present in src/configs
GENOME:
    "GRCh38"


# Adapter sequences to trim from the 3' end of each read
# * These are passed to the -a and -A arguments of cutadapt
READ_1_ADAPTER:
    "AACTGTAGGCACCATCAAT"

READ_2_ADAPTER:
    "GATCGTCGGACTGTAGAACTCT"


# Specify base URL and destination to transfer bigwigs

# Sample groups for subsampling, use the following format:
# * The top level name will be the section name for the knitted document.
# * Samples included in each sampling group will be subsampled to the same read
#   depth, so for each group select samples you want to directly compare.
# * The sample must match the beginning of a fastq file in one of the
#   RAW_DATA directories.
# * All samples listed for a section will be plotted together.
# * Each sample can be given a name to use when creating plots, if this
#   is excluded, names will be auto-generated.
# * Sampling groups can be included in multiple sections. This allows the samples
#   to be plotted in different combinations.
