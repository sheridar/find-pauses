# Sample groups for subsampling, use the following format:
# * The top level name will be the section name for the knitted document.
# * Samples included in each sampling group will be subsampled to the same read
#   depth, so for each group select samples you want to directly compare.
# * The sample must match the beginning of a fastq file in one of the
#   RAW_DATA directories.
# * All samples listed for a section will be plotted together.
# * Each sample should be given a name to use for labeling plots
# * Sampling groups can be included in multiple sections. This allows the samples
#   to be plotted in different combinations.
