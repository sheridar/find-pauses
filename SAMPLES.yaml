# Sample groups to use for subsampling, use the following format. The
# samples included in each group will be subsampled to the same read
# depth, so for each group select samples you want to directly compare.
# The sample names must match the beginning of a fastq file in one of the
# directories listed under RAW_DATA in NETseq.yaml. If the sample name
# matches multiple fastqs, an error will be thrown.
